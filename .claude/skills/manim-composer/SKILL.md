  Trigger when: (1) User wants to create an educational/explainer video, (2) User has a vague concept they want visualized, (3) User mentions "3b1b style" or "explain like 3Blue1Brown", (4) User wants to plan a Manim video or animation sequence, (5) User asks to "compose" or "plan" a math/science visualization.

  Transforms vague video ideas into detailed scene-by-scene plans (scenes.md). Conducts research, asks clarifying questions about audience/scope/focus, and outputs comprehensive scene specifications ready for implementation with ManimCE, optionally using the OpenGL renderer for 3D scenes.

  Use this BEFORE writing any Manim code. This skill plans the video; use manimce-best-practices for implementation and manimgl-best-practices only as the 3D OpenGL companion.
---

## Workflow

Default implementation target is Manim Community v0.20.1. Keep technical notes modern and API-specific: use `from manim import *`, `MathTex`, `Write` for text/math, `Create` for geometry, and `ThreeDScene.set_camera_orientation` / `move_camera` for 3D camera work. For OpenGL-only 3D scenes, add `from manim.opengl import *` and set `config.renderer = "opengl"` before mobject construction.

### Phase 1: Understand the Concept

1. **Research the topic** deeply before asking questions
   - Use web search to understand the core concepts
   - Identify the key insights that make this topic interesting
   - Find the "aha moment" - what makes this click for learners
   - Note common misconceptions to address

2. **Identify the narrative hook**
   - What question does this video answer?
   - Why should the viewer care?
   - What's the surprising or counterintuitive element?

### Phase 2: Clarify with User

Ask targeted questions (not all at once - adapt based on responses):

**Audience & Scope**
- What math/science background should I assume? (e.g., "knows calculus" or "high school algebra")
- Target video length? (short: 5-10min, medium: 15-20min, long: 30min+)
- Should this be self-contained or part of a series?

**Focus & Depth**
- Any specific aspects to emphasize or skip?
- Proof-heavy or intuition-focused?
- Real-world applications to include?

**Style Preferences**
- Color scheme preferences?
- Narration style? (casual, formal, playful)
- Any specific visual metaphors you have in mind?

### Phase 3: Create scenes.md

Output a comprehensive `scenes.md` file with this structure:

```markdown

## 3b1b Style Principles

Apply these principles when composing scenes:

### Visual Storytelling
- **Show, don't just tell** - Every concept needs a visual representation
- **Progressive revelation** - Build complexity gradually, don't show everything at once
- **Visual continuity** - Transform objects rather than replacing them when possible

### Pacing & Rhythm
- **Pause for insight** - Give viewers time to absorb key moments
- **Vary the pace** - Mix quick sequences with slower explanations
- **End scenes with resolution** - Each scene should feel complete

### Mathematical Beauty
- **Emphasize elegance** - Highlight when math is surprisingly simple or beautiful
- **Connect representations** - Show the same concept multiple ways (algebraic, geometric, intuitive)
- **Embrace abstraction gradually** - Start concrete, then generalize

### Engagement Techniques
- **Pose questions** - Make viewers curious before revealing answers
- **Acknowledge difficulty** - "This might seem confusing at first..."
- **Celebrate insight** - Make the "aha moment" feel earned
